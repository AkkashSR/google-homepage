This is the first exercise in The Odin Project.

Using HTML and CSS only.
Trying to get familiar with CSS is the main goal for me here.
Will try to comeback and improve on it further.

TO DO:
1) Include media-queries, so that mobile users can use the site properly without any misalignments.
2) To also make improvements on the border elements.
